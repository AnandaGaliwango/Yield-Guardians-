# Yield-Guardians-

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model for crop yield prediction using key agricultural and environmental factors. The model leverages historical data, including weather conditions, soil properties, and crop type, to provide accurate yield estimates. By utilizing machine learning techniques, this model aims to help farmers and agricultural experts make informed decisions, optimize resource allocation, and improve productivity.
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of multiple features relevant to crop growth, such as temperature, rainfall and soil type. Various preprocessing techniques have been applied, including normalization, handling missing values, and feature selection, to improve model performance. The algorithm that was explored if knowledge distillation to predict crop yields.
The repository contains the complete code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
